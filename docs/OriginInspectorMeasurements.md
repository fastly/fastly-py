# OriginInspectorMeasurements

A measurements object provides a count of the total number of `responses` received by Fastly from your origin servers in the reported time period, for the relevant POP and backend name as specified in the [entry](#entry-data-model). It also includes the number of responses for specific HTTP response status codes and for status code ranges. This dataset is sparse: only the keys with non-zero values will be included in the record. Where a specific status code does not have a field in this model (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`), any responses with that code will be counted as part of the range count (`4xx` in this case) but will not be separately identified in the data.
