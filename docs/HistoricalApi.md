# **get_usage**
> HistoricalUsageAggregateResponse get_usage()

Get usage statistics

Returns usage information aggregated across all Fastly services and grouped by region. To aggregate across all Fastly services by time period, see [`/stats/aggregate`](#get-hist-stats-aggregated).

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (token):

```python
import time
import fastly
from fastly.api import historical_api
from fastly.model.historical_usage_aggregate_response import HistoricalUsageAggregateResponse
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.fastly.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = fastly.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.fastly.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fastly.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = historical_api.HistoricalApi(api_client)
    _from = "2020-04-09T18:14:30Z" # str | Timestamp that defines the start of the window for which to fetch statistics, including the timestamp itself. Accepts Unix timestamps, or any form of input parsable by the [Chronic Ruby library](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic), such as 'yesterday', or 'two weeks ago'. Default varies based on the value of `by`.  (optional)
    to = "2020-04-09T18:14:30Z" # str | Timestamp that defines the end of the window for which to fetch statistics. Accepts the same formats as `from`.  (optional) if omitted the server will use the default value of "now"

    # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
    # and optional values
    try:
        # Get usage statistics
        api_response = api_instance.get_usage(_from=_from, to=to)
        pprint(api_response)
    except fastly.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling HistoricalApi->get_usage: %s\n" % e)

# **get_usage_month**
> HistoricalUsageMonthResponse get_usage_month()

Get month-to-date usage statistics

Returns month-to-date usage details for a given month and year. Usage details are aggregated by service and across all Fastly services, and then grouped by region. This endpoint does not use the `from` or `to` fields for selecting the date for which data is requested. Instead, it uses `month` and `year` integer fields. Both fields are optional and default to the current month and year respectively. When set, an optional `billable_units` field will convert bandwidth to GB and divide requests by 10,000.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (token):

```python
import time
import fastly
from fastly.api import historical_api
from fastly.model.historical_usage_month_response import HistoricalUsageMonthResponse
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.fastly.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = fastly.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.fastly.com"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: token
configuration.api_key['token'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['token'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with fastly.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = historical_api.HistoricalApi(api_client)
    year = "2020" # str | 4-digit year. (optional)
    month = "05" # str | 2-digit month. (optional)
    billable_units = True # bool | If `true`, return results as billable units. (optional)

    # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
    # and optional values
    try:
        # Get month-to-date usage statistics
        api_response = api_instance.get_usage_month(year=year, month=month, billable_units=billable_units)
        pprint(api_response)
    except fastly.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling HistoricalApi->get_usage_month: %s\n" % e)
