# DomainInspectorRealtimeEntry

Each reporting period is represented by an entry in the `Data` property of the top level response and provides access to [measurement data](#measurements-data-model) for that time period, grouped in various ways: by domain name, domain IP address, and optionally by POP. The `datacenter` property organizes the measurements by Fastly POP, while the `aggregated` property combines the measurements of all POPs (but still splits by backend name and IP). 

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**recorded** | [**RecordedTimestamp**](RecordedTimestamp.md) |  | [optional] 
**aggregated** | **{str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)}** | Groups [measurements](#measurements-data-model) by backend name and then by IP address. | [optional] 
**datacenter** | **{str: ({str: (bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type)},)}** | Groups [measurements](#measurements-data-model) by POP, then backend name, and then IP address. See the [POPs API](/reference/api/utils/pops/) for details about POP identifiers. | [optional] 
**any string name** | **bool, date, datetime, dict, float, int, list, str, none_type** | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
