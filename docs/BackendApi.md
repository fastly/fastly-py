### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **service_id** | **str**| Alphanumeric string identifying the service. |
 **version_id** | **int**| Integer identifying a service version. |
 **backend_name** | **str**| The name of the backend. |
 **address** | **str**| A hostname, IPv4, or IPv6 address for the backend. This is the preferred way to specify the location of your backend. | [optional]
 **auto_loadbalance** | **bool**| Whether or not this backend should be automatically load balanced. If true, all backends with this setting that don&#39;t have a `request_condition` will be selected based on their `weight`. | [optional]
 **between_bytes_timeout** | **int**| Maximum duration in milliseconds that Fastly will wait while receiving no data on a download from a backend. If exceeded, the response received so far will be considered complete and the fetch will end. May be set at runtime using `bereq.between_bytes_timeout`. | [optional]
 **client_cert** | **str, none_type**| Unused. | [optional]
 **comment** | **str, none_type**| A freeform descriptive note. | [optional]
 **connect_timeout** | **int**| Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for a connection to this backend to be established. If exceeded, the connection is aborted and a synthethic `503` response will be presented instead. May be set at runtime using `bereq.connect_timeout`. | [optional]
 **first_byte_timeout** | **int**| Maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for the server response to begin after a TCP connection is established and the request has been sent. If exceeded, the connection is aborted and a synthethic `503` response will be presented instead. May be set at runtime using `bereq.first_byte_timeout`. | [optional]
 **healthcheck** | **str, none_type**| The name of the healthcheck to use with this backend. | [optional]
 **hostname** | **str, none_type**| The hostname of the backend. May be used as an alternative to `address` to set the backend location. | [optional]
 **ipv4** | **str, none_type**| IPv4 address of the backend. May be used as an alternative to `address` to set the backend location. | [optional]
 **ipv6** | **str, none_type**| IPv6 address of the backend. May be used as an alternative to `address` to set the backend location. | [optional]
 **keepalive_time** | **int, none_type**| How long in seconds to keep a persistent connection to the backend between requests. | [optional]
 **max_conn** | **int**| Maximum number of concurrent connections this backend will accept. | [optional]
 **max_tls_version** | **str, none_type**| Maximum allowed TLS version on SSL connections to this backend. If your backend server is not able to negotiate a connection meeting this constraint, a synthetic `503` error response will be generated. | [optional]
 **min_tls_version** | **str, none_type**| Minimum allowed TLS version on SSL connections to this backend. If your backend server is not able to negotiate a connection meeting this constraint, a synthetic `503` error response will be generated. | [optional]
 **name** | **str**| The name of the backend. | [optional]
 **override_host** | **str, none_type**| If set, will replace the client-supplied HTTP `Host` header on connections to this backend. Applied after VCL has been processed, so this setting will take precedence over changing `bereq.http.Host` in VCL. | [optional]
 **port** | **int**| Port on which the backend server is listening for connections from Fastly. Setting `port` to 80 or 443 will also set `use_ssl` automatically (to false and true respectively), unless explicitly overridden by setting `use_ssl` in the same request. | [optional]
 **request_condition** | **str**| Name of a Condition, which if satisfied, will select this backend during a request. If set, will override any `auto_loadbalance` setting. By default, the first backend added to a service is selected for all requests. | [optional]
 **shield** | **str, none_type**| Identifier of the POP to use as a [shield](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/shielding). | [optional]
 **ssl_ca_cert** | **str, none_type**| CA certificate attached to origin. | [optional]
 **ssl_cert_hostname** | **str, none_type**| Overrides `ssl_hostname`, but only for cert verification. Does not affect SNI at all. | [optional]
 **ssl_check_cert** | **bool**| Be strict on checking SSL certs. | [optional] if omitted the server will use the default value of True
 **ssl_ciphers** | **str, none_type**| List of [OpenSSL ciphers](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/ciphers.html) to support for connections to this origin. If your backend server is not able to negotiate a connection meeting this constraint, a synthetic `503` error response will be generated. | [optional]
 **ssl_client_cert** | **str, none_type**| Client certificate attached to origin. | [optional]
 **ssl_client_key** | **str, none_type**| Client key attached to origin. | [optional]
 **ssl_hostname** | **str, none_type**| Use `ssl_cert_hostname` and `ssl_sni_hostname` to configure certificate validation. | [optional]
 **ssl_sni_hostname** | **str, none_type**| Overrides `ssl_hostname`, but only for SNI in the handshake. Does not affect cert validation at all. | [optional]
 **use_ssl** | **bool**| Whether or not to require TLS for connections to this backend. | [optional]
 **weight** | **int**| Weight used to load balance this backend against others. May be any positive integer. If `auto_loadbalance` is true, the chance of this backend being selected is equal to its own weight over the sum of all weights for backends that have `auto_loadbalance` set to true. | [optional]
