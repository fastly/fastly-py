## [0.3.0] - July 10, 2019: 
### Added

- This `CHANGELOG.md` file
- `create` and `delete` methods to Model base
- Convenience methods to Service for fetching details and active version number

### Fixed

- Updated Service.version and Version.vcl to use new Model.create
- Compare `attrs` and `_original_attrs` before saving. (Without this check, calling .save() on an instance without changed attributes makes a PUT call with no data. Then instance.attrs is set to the error response for an incomplete API call, e.g. {"msg": "Missing parameter", "detail": "param is missing or the value is empty: item_value"})
Added missing VCL import to fastly.py

## [0.2.3] - August 2019
## Added

## Fixed
- Updates API models
